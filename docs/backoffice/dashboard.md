## Objective
The Dashboard provides a summary view of remittance processing across the platform to support operational awareness and daily monitoring.

## What You See
Typical dashboard components include:

- **Transaction Volume**: total transactions for selected time range;
- **Transaction Value**: total FCY/PKR values processed;
- **Status Breakdown**: Completed; Pending; Failed; In Review;
- **Partner Distribution**: volume by MTO/partner;
- **Branch Distribution**: volume by branch code (where applicable);
- **Compliance Queue**: number of transactions awaiting compliance action.

## How to Use
1. Open **Backoffice → Dashboard**.
2. Select the desired date range (if available).
3. Use the KPI cards and charts to identify:
   - spikes in failure rate;
   - partner-specific anomalies;
   - backlog buildup in compliance queue.

## Operational Guidance
- If compliance queue count grows unexpectedly, prioritize **Compliance Review** module.
- If one partner shows abnormal failure, validate partner configuration and recent integration changes.
- Use Transactions search to drill down into samples and confirm root cause.
