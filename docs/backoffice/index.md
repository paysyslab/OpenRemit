## Overview

The OpenRemit Backoffice provides operational users with visibility and control over remittance transactions processed through the platform.

The Backoffice supports monitoring and review of transactions across different processing stages. It provides a centralized view of transaction status and enables operational handling when transactions require investigation or follow-up.

The Backoffice supports operational oversight for transactions that pass through validation, compliance checks, routing, and settlement steps. It provides a practical operational interface for day-to-day remittance operations.

## Core Capabilities

### Transaction Search and Inquiry

The Backoffice enables users to search for transactions and perform transaction inquiry.

Users can locate a transaction using available identifiers and references. The Backoffice presents transaction status and key processing outcomes, enabling operational teams to understand whether the platform completed the transaction or whether it requires further handling.

Transaction inquiry supports operational follow-up. It enables operational users to answer partner inquiries, investigate transaction delays, and verify settlement outcomes using traceable transaction states.

### Real-Time Transaction Status Visibility

The Backoffice provides visibility into transaction status across the platform lifecycle.

It shows where a transaction sits in the processing flow, such as received, validated, pending, failed, or completed.

This visibility supports operational continuity. It allows teams to identify delayed transactions and focus on transactions that require intervention based on their current status.

---

### Compliance and Screening Review Support

The Backoffice supports operational review for transactions that require compliance or screening attention.

It enables operational users to identify flagged transactions and review their screening outcomes.

This support helps operational teams handle review-driven transactions through controlled workflows and ensures the platform remains aligned with compliance processes.

---

### Manual Intervention and Exception Handling

The Backoffice supports manual handling of transactions that require operational action due to exceptions.

Operational users can identify failed or pending transactions and take appropriate follow-up actions according to operational policy.

Exception handling supports stable operations. It enables teams to monitor failures, respond to processing issues, and maintain operational control over transaction outcomes.

---

### Audit and Operational Reporting

The Backoffice supports audit and operational reporting through transaction traceability and action logging.

It enables teams to review transaction histories and understand processing stages reached by a transaction.

This reporting capability supports accountability by enabling operational review of what occurred, when it occurred, and what operational actions were taken in response.

---

## Operational Flows

Backoffice users review transactions at multiple stages of processing, including received, validated, pending, failed, and completed states.

The Backoffice supports operational handling based on transaction status and configured permissions. It enables operational users to focus on transactions requiring attention while maintaining visibility across the full transaction set.

Backoffice operational flow typically includes:
- Search and locate the transaction
- Review current status and processing outcome
- Identify whether the transaction requires further review
- Perform operational follow-up where applicable
- Record actions for audit tracking

---

## Roles and Access

The Backoffice controls access using role-based access management.

Different roles receive permissions aligned with their operational responsibilities. These permissions control what users can view and what operational functions they can perform.

Role-based access ensures that the Backoffice supports operational segregation. It helps ensure that users only access functions required for their operational scope and supports internal governance.

---

## Audit and Monitoring

The Backoffice logs operational actions to support audit requirements.

The platform maintains an audit trail for operational accountability. This audit trail supports regulatory compliance and internal reviews by preserving a record of actions performed through the Backoffice.

Audit and monitoring support includes:
- Logging of operational actions
- Traceability of transaction states and outcomes
- Operational visibility for monitoring and oversight
